  <p>Scott Armstrong, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Employment and Social Development, today hosted a roundtable on how to strengthen the Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDAs). This is part of a series of roundtables that Mr. Armstrong will host, in cooperation with provincial and territorial governments, across Canada.</p>
  <p>As part of its plan for creating jobs, economic growth, and long-term prosperity, the Government of Canada is committed to strengthening LMDAs to reorient training toward labour market demand. It is expected that the new LMDAs will better connect Canadians with available jobs by ensuring they have access to training for the skills employers need. Funded through the Employment Insurance (EI) program, the Government of Canada transfers over $2 billion annually to the provinces and territories through the LMDAs to provide skills training to EI clients and employment services to all unemployed Canadians.</p>
  <p>The roundtables give governments, employers, and other stakeholders an opportunity to discuss how to make the LMDAs more employer-driven and responsive to the needs of the labour market. The roundtables also give the Government of Canada valuable insight on local skills shortages and gaps.</p>
