<p>Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird today welcomed the official announcement by the Indonesian National Electoral Commission that Mr. Joko Widodo and his running mate, Mr. Jusuf Kalla, have won Indonesia’s 2014 presidential election, held on July 9.</p>

<p>“Canada warmly congratulates president-elect Joko Widodo and his campaign on their success. We are optimistic about Indonesia’s future, and I plan to visit there again in the very near future,” said Baird.</p>

<p>“Indonesia is the world’s third-largest democracy, with 190 million registered voters. Today’s result underscores the impressive strides that Indonesia and its institutions have made in the 10 years since its first democratic elections.”</p>
