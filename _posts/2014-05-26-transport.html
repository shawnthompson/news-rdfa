                    <h2>Indoor Secure Bike Parking area opens at Main Street-Science World Station</h2>
                    <p>Just in time for Bike to Work Week (<time datetime="2014-05-26">May 26</time> to <time datetime="2014-06-01">June 1, 2014</time>), TransLink is pleased to announce the opening of the new Secure Bike Parking area at Main Street-Science World SkyTrain Station. The Secure Bike Parking area is located indoors, inside the newly upgraded east stationhouse, and boasts 86 bike racks, more than four times the number of bike lockers that used to sit outside the station.</p>
                    <p>The new Secure Bike Parking area is a first of its kind on TransLink’s transit network. The facility is accessible by key card and costs just $1 a day up to a maximum of $8 a month, plus a one-time $8 registration fee. The program is also expanding. Secure Bike Parking areas will replace bike lockers at some of TransLink’s busiest stations and bus loops over the next few years.</p>
                    <p>Main Street-Science World is one of seven stations along the Expo Line being upgraded with funding from federal and provincial partners. The station upgrades include an expanded east stationhouse, new escalators, stairs and elevator, a new west station entrance and the Secure Bike Parking area.</p>
                    <p>The budget for all the Main Street-Science World Station upgrades, including the Secure Bike Parking area, is $33 million. The Government of Canada is contributing $7 million from the Building Canada Fund, the Province of British Columbia is contributing $14 million, and TransLink is contributing $12 million.</p>
