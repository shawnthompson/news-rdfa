    <h2>The Government of Canada to invest up to $5.5 million to restore recreational fisheries habitat through the National Conservation Plan</h2>
    <p>The Honourable Gail Shea, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, today announced investments by the Government of Canada to support conservation projects in Newfoundland and Labrador through the Recreational Fisheries Conservation Partnerships Program (RFCPP). Under the second round of the program, over $160,000 is awarded to five projects in the province to rebuild, restore and rehabilitate fish habitat.</p>
    <p>The Recreational Fisheries Conservation Partnerships Program was announced in Economic Action Plan 2013 to support fisheries habitat restoration projects led by recreational fishing and angling groups, as well as conservation organizations. Given its early success and high demand, an additional investment in Economic Action Plan 2014 increased the funding available through the program to a total investment of $25 million.</p>
    <p>On May 15, 2014, the National Conservation Plan was launched to provide a more coordinated approach to conservation efforts across the country. Since 2006, the Government of Canada has taken important steps to conserve and restore our country&rsquo;s natural environment and connect Canadians to our rich natural heritage. To date, the Recreational Fisheries Conservation Partnerships Program has invested nearly $6 million (Round I), in 94 fisheries habitat restoration projects across Canada and funding to support up to an additional 127 projects (Round II) is currently underway. The window to apply for Round III funding is now open and applications will be accepted until August 15, 2014</p>
